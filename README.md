# To do app

## Description

This is a task management application that enables users to add, modify, and delete tasks within a selected day in calendar view. Once a day is selected, users can easily navigate through their tasks, search for specific tasks, hide tasks that have already been completed and click on individual tasks to view more details. Additionally, users can modify their authentication credentials if needed.

It's developed in Android Studio and uses multiple fragments along with a bottom navigation menu to enable navigation throughout the app, with Room library used for data persistence.

## Motivation

This is my first Android project, which I completed as a university assignment.
